tvsquared-collector-ios
=======================

This the TVSquared collector iOS integration code. This comprises a complete sample iOS application which demonstrates
how to use the integration's API.

When integrating to your own code, the only files you actually need to include are "TVSquaredCollectorSample/TVSquaredCollector.h" and 
"TVSquaredCollectorSample/TVSquaredCollector.m". All others are part of the sample application code. 

To use the sample, you will need to change the &lt;COLLECTORHOSTNAME&gt; and &lt;COLLECTORSITEID>&gt;t n  "TVSquaredCollectorSample/TVSViewController.m" to the values described on our website.
